            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:43990:2" rendition="simple:additions"/> the effects upon the 7th Angells ≈øounding, as that by reading the Chapters is cleere and manife≈øt; I ≈øhall not need to make any further proof that <hi>Babilon</hi> ≈øhall fall upon the holding forth of the everla≈øting Go≈øpel. I mean when it is ≈øo preached and ≈øo received as the everla≈øting Go≈øpell, for ≈øuch is the Go≈øpell of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, it is both a Go≈øpell <hi>to wit</hi> glad-tidings, and it is the Go≈øpell, the glad-tidings, <hi>to wit</hi> the only glad-tidings that are everla≈øting; to them that dwell on the earth, and therefore ≈øhall be preached to every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, kinred, and tongue, and people; <hi>Saying</hi> (more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over) <hi>fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: and wor≈øhip him which hath made heaven and earth, and the ≈øea, and the fountaines of waters,</hi> ≈øee Chap. <hi>14.6, 7.</hi> And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo is Go≈øpell, for it is glad-tidings when the hour of his Judgment is come, and his advice is good, to fear God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in regard he is ≈øaid to ≈øay it with a loud voyce. It is intimated that it ≈øhould be more audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ≈øpoken, and more generally heard and received then it had been formerly, and that by all nations, kinreds, tongues, and peoples. And it may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to con≈øider, that it is ≈øaid and ≈øworn by the Angell, that <hi>in the dayes of the voyce of the 7th An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, when he ≈øhall begin to ≈øound the mi≈øtery of God ≈øhall be fini≈øhed, as he hath declared to his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets,</hi> ≈øee Chap. <hi>10.7.</hi> Not that all ≈øhould be fini≈øhed when he ≈øhall begin to ≈øound; for in that there is a beginning it implieth a continuance; And it is ≈øaid al≈øo that in the dayes of the voyce <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the mi≈øtery of God ≈øhall be fini≈øhed: Now how many dayes the voyce of this ≈øounding ≈øhall continue it is not ea≈øily determined, being only held forth in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number without limitation: But this is certain,
<pb facs="tcp:43990:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> that when he ≈øhall begin, his ≈øounding ≈øhall continue till the mi≈øtery of God be fini≈øhed.</p>
            <p>Now ≈øee the fir≈øt effects or what is fully concluded on, and voted in the Church, and by the four and twenty El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders when the 7th Angell begun to ≈øound <hi>Chap. 11.15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</hi> And it evidently appeareth, that <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world ≈øhall certainly become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri≈øt, and he ≈øhall</hi> (thenceforth) <hi>reign for ever and ever.</hi> For which there is thanks ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the holy Elders, <hi>becau≈øe he had taken to him his great power, and had reigned,</hi> and how, <hi>the nations were angry,</hi> &amp;c. ≈øee and read the ver≈øes, for they doe concern us if we be chri≈øtians indeed, and not in ≈øhew only, and that in the≈øe dayes, and for our great comfort and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in the wayes of God, they are held forth to us. For hath he not begun, hath he not already taken to him≈øelfe even his great power, and hath reigned among≈øt us; Hath he not <hi>given a bannor to them that fear him,</hi> P≈øal. <hi>60.4.</hi> Hath he not begun, <hi>and ≈øhall he not make an end, 1</hi> Sam. <hi>3.12.</hi> Hath he not already <hi>whett his glittering ≈øword,</hi> and hath not <hi>his hand</hi> already <hi>taken hold of vengeance;</hi> And ≈øhall he not <hi>fully recompence his adver≈øaries, and repay them that hate him,</hi> ≈øee Deuter. <hi>32.40, 41, 42, 43.</hi> And hath he not owned this nation, yea even this of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that as fir≈øt, yea and al≈øo above others, yea even any nation now under Heaven; And that for his own cau≈øe ≈øake, though not for our worthine≈ø≈øe, but for re≈øpect to his name, the which through his grace was owned by us again≈øt his adver≈øaries; Yea and that by a ≈øtrong hand, and a ≈øtretched out arme, many a time giving victory to a few again≈øt their double number, and that to weake and de≈øpi≈øed ones again≈øt the ≈øtrong and potent, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our hopes and expectations, or the fears of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øaries, and that by ≈øea and land. And why ≈øhould we
<pb facs="tcp:43990:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> think that he will repent him for his choice of us before any nation now under heaven. The Apo≈øtle telleth us <hi>his gifts and callings are without repentance,</hi> Rom. <hi>11.29.</hi> And though he <hi>will oblitterate the names of ≈øuch out of his book of life</hi> (as he ≈øaid unto Mo≈øes) <hi>who ≈øin again≈øt him</hi> (Exod. <hi>32.32, 33.</hi>) yet <hi>he will be mercifull unto his land and to his people.</hi> And therefore he ≈øaith: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce oh ye nations with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his ≈øervants, and will render vengeance to his adver≈øaries, and will be mercifull to his land and people,</hi> ≈øee Deut. <hi>32.43.</hi> And of this we may be confident that he that hath begun will certainly make an end, before he break off from us whom he hath owned as a peculiar people in a nationall way, and that above any nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, as once he did to <hi>I≈ørael</hi> of old. And will bring us to re≈øt and ≈øettlement in ≈øpite of all oppo≈øers, either forraine or dome≈øtick. And he will give <hi>victory on the Lambs ≈øide, together with them who are the called, &amp; cho≈øen and faithfull. His heart is towards the governors of</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>who have jeoparded their lives (to maintaine his cau≈øe) upon the high places of the field; with</hi> Zebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <hi>and</hi> Napthali, ≈øee Judges <hi>5.9.18. for they offered them≈øelves willingly among≈øt the people, and have not loved their lives even unto the death,</hi> Rev. <hi>12.11. And therefore rejoyce ye heavens</hi> (that is to ≈øay ye Churches, militant and triumphant) <hi>and ye that dwell in them, but woe to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the Sea;</hi> (that is to the world) <hi>for the Devill is come downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt you, having great wrath, becau≈øe he knoweth that he hath but a ≈øhort time,</hi> ver≈ø. <hi>12.</hi> to wit, till he mu≈øt <hi>be inclo≈øed in the bottomle≈ø≈øe pit, that he ≈øhall not deceive the nations any more till a thou≈øand years ≈øhall be fulfilled,</hi> ≈øee Rev. <hi>20.1, 2, 3.</hi> Yea <hi>woe unto the world becau≈øe of offences, for</hi> (though) <hi>it mu≈øt needs be that

            <p>Now if it be ≈øo much danger to offend but one of the lea≈øt of tho≈øe little ones, that beleeve in Chri≈øt, as that it <hi>were better for him that a mil≈øtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were ca≈øt into the depth of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. How dangerous is it to offend his Emba≈ø≈øadors that are ≈øent unto us in the name of the Lord, for the good of our ≈øouls; Is it not ≈øaid, <hi>He that receiveth you recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that ≈øent me; And he that de≈øpi≈øeth you de≈øpi≈øeth me, and he that de≈øpi≈øeth me, de≈øpi≈øeth him that ≈øent me;</hi> But how few is there in the≈øe our dayes that regard the≈øe words, or at lea≈øt ≈øo regard them as to caution them as they ought in the≈øe re≈øpects. Are not the words of men in
<pb facs="tcp:43990:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> authority as Magi≈øtrates and Officers, and ma≈øters much more regarded then the≈øe words of Chri≈øt. They that are under command, under any authority, either civill or mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, will quickly ≈øay we are ≈øo commanded, and we mu≈øt obey el≈øe it will be wor≈øe for us, we ≈øhall be turned out of office, or out of our ≈øervice, or places el≈øe, or tho≈øe our ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours will be offended with us, and for ≈øuch like rea≈øons which in ≈øuch ca≈øes are good and wi≈øe, and but our duty, but how few is there that are ≈øo wi≈øely ≈øub≈øervient to the commands of God, and of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and to take his coun≈øells and admonitions, and lay them to heart, and own them as a rule for regulation of all their wayes. But if you plea≈øe to read with ≈øeriou≈øne≈ø≈øe of ≈øpirit, but this little Treati≈øe, you will ea≈øily perceive how much we are ≈øhort of obedience, and ≈øub≈øerviencie to the commands of Chri≈øt, yea even the be≈øt of us all, and ≈øo what need there is to make it our bu≈øine≈ø≈øe to indeavour a redre≈ø≈øe, what in us lyeth, in our places and callings, and to provoke one another to love and good works which are ≈øo much wanting. And for this end I have directed it to you who are in highe≈øt authority, though I therein ≈øpeak not to you only, but to all that are or profe≈ø≈øe them≈øelves to be chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed, &amp; not in ≈øhew only: that you &amp; all ≈øuch might incourage and induce what in them lieth to a cordiall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of hearts and affections in the wayes of God. For though it is a thing that cannot po≈ø≈øibly be compelled to by humane authority, yet it much conduceth and helpeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when the eyes of authority are bent that wayes. The incouragement of authority in well doing, is a ≈øtrong inducement to the doing of it.

            <p n="1">1. From the command of God, Lev. 19.18. <hi>thou ≈øhalt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge nor bear any grudge again≈øt the children of thy people, but then ≈øhalt love thy neighbour as thy ≈øelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is al≈øo the command of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, Mat. 22.19. &amp; Luke 10.27, 28. where the command is expre≈ø≈øed. <hi>This doe and thou ≈øhalt live,</hi> &amp; John 15.17. <hi>This I command you, that ye love one another.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

And ≈øee al≈øo John 13 34. <hi>A new commandement I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye al≈øo love one another;</hi> From which it evidently appeareth, that though this commandement is but the ≈øame in ≈øub≈øtance which was from the beginning.

            <p n="8">8. And the Apo≈øtle <hi>John</hi> ≈øeriou≈øly exhorteth us to it, ≈øhewing us a ≈øtrong rea≈øon to induce us, <hi>to wit, Beloved</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God, and he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love,</hi> Chap. 4.7, 8. It is therefore ≈øtyled <hi>the royal Law,</hi> James 2.8. Becau≈øe it cometh both expre≈ø≈øely and e≈ø≈øentially from God the Father, and from our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. Now in regard it is both the expre≈ø≈øe command to love one another; and the e≈ø≈øentiall and efficient worke of the Spirit of God for it both cometh of God, and God is love. And in regard that the end of the commandement is love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the whole Law, <hi>to wit,</hi> that re≈øpects our neighbour is fulfilled in this, <hi>to wit. Thou ≈øhalt love thy neighbour as thy ≈øelf,</hi> and that this is that ≈øecond great commandement, and ≈øo like the fir≈øt; as that <hi>he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ≈øeen,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>love God whom he hath not ≈øeen.</hi> Nor manife≈øt him≈øelfe to be his Di≈øciple, nor indeed a true Chri≈øtian, See 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. &amp; Ch. 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it nece≈ø≈øarily followeth that ≈øuch who are Chri≈øtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and expect to be ≈øo accepted and accounted of either with God or men, ought to account them≈øelves mo≈øt chiefly bound to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43990:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> this duty of love, and that to all the <hi>brotherhood,</hi> above all other duties commanded in the Law that concerns our neighbour. And that in regard that all other dutyes are inferiour, and <hi>le≈ø≈øer matters of the Law,</hi> As tithing <hi>of Mint, Anni≈ø≈øe, and Cumin</hi> was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which yet <hi>ought to be done,</hi> provided that <hi>Judgement, mercy, and faith,</hi> which are the greater matters be not thereby neglected nor ≈øecluded; for this was in the Scribes and Phari≈øees a token of their hypocri≈øie; and how can we po≈ø≈øibly excu≈øe our ≈øelves from the ≈øame charge, if by our ≈øtrivings and conte≈øts about inferiour outward circum≈øtantiall matters and things of God, as Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall matters and wayes of government and mini≈øtration?</p>
            <p>We neglect and hinder the growth of love and ≈øo of faith like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe which are the two e≈ø≈øencialls and only infallible marks of our Chri≈øtianity; And on the contrary part doe thereby provoke one another to wrath and enmity, biting and devouring one another till we be con≈øumed, as is but ju≈øt with God, becau≈øe we cannot agree but fall out by the way, and that about the way like unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward children who part them≈øelves into various pathes till they are be wildred and loo≈øe one another and ≈øome them≈øelves and their poor ≈øoules. And con≈øidering al≈øo that all the ordinances of God, and the wayes of government, and all the mini≈øtrations and gifts of God, with all the mini≈øtrators whom he hath ≈øent, and ≈øet in his Church, yea all the inferiour commandements in the morral Law, with all the Prophets, Apo≈øtles, Scriptures both old and new, yea all the truths and doctrines or examples therein held forth, both concerning Judgements and mercies with all other wayes and means of grace. Are all but given and held forth to us through the nece≈ø≈øary meanes, for this nece≈ø≈øary end, <hi>to wit,</hi> The producing of <hi>love out of a pure heart, and of a good con≈øcience, and of faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained.</hi> See 1 Tim: 1.5. From all which I make bold to conclude, that if we make not the ob≈øervance and u≈øe thereof, as helps and means conducing to the acquirement and fulfilling of this end, but in our keeping of the le≈ø≈øer we ob≈øtruct the greater, yea and even the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then without all que≈øtion or peradventure we quite pervert the end of all the commandements and meanes of grace that God hath appointed at lea≈øt ≈øo far forth as we u≈øe them ≈øo as hath been

            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. I an≈øwer, It is true, that it is an old and maine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Church pollicy, but I for my part could never learn from what Scripture ground it could be proved lawfull.</p>

            <p>Now if we doe not receive one another to the outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Chri≈øtian communion, which are all the glory that we can received and admit them too, how doe we follow Chri≈øt who hath received us to the glory of God the Father? which is the highe≈øt and greate≈øt glory that he him≈øelfe can have. And this his love to us hath ingaged him to, <hi>when as yet we were ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it alwayes looked ≈øo like to the practi≈øe of <hi>Diotrephes, who loved to have the preheminence, and received not the Apo≈øtle John, nor the brethren,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>But this I dare affirme, and have alwayes ≈øo accounted it as a dangerous thing, for any Church, or any part or member of a Church, <hi>neither to receive the brethren, nor ≈øuffer them that would,</hi> (See 3 John 9, 10, 11.) e≈øpecially con≈øidering there is no ground that I yet know of in all the Scripture for ≈øuch a policy, but is meerly invented to ingage or inforce men to their own principles, and practi≈øes, whether their judgements be convinced of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe thereof, yea or no, the which is not Chri≈øtian, it is not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be ≈øaid, if they be not incorporated with us, and ingage to the government of the Church, we have no power to exerci≈øe any authoritative di≈øcipline over them, nor doe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our ≈øelves ingaged to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I an≈øwer, The Church hath as much power from Chri≈øt, and is as much ingaged in duty to exerci≈øe it over any <hi>that is called a brother,</hi> and owned as a brother, as if they were ingaged and incorporated with them in the ≈øame Church, and this ought to be declared among≈øt all the Churches, See Levit. 19.17. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. and 1 Cor. 5.11, 12, 13. and 2 The≈ø≈øa. 3.6.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Now it cannot be denyed, but we ought to love and not hate our brother in our heart, but we cannot ≈øhew that we love him, if we doe not rebuke him, <hi>but ≈øuffer ≈øin upon him;</hi> And therefore it is ≈øaid, <hi>thou ≈øhalt in any wi≈øe rebuke him,</hi> which implyeth that no excu≈øe mu≈øt ≈øerve our turne, as that he is not of our Church, or way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or it belongeth to the Church he is of to deal with him this will not ≈øerve to ≈øhew our love to him, but rather that we hate him, See Lev. 19.17. So that all the injunctions that lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, that ingage us to any duty to our brethren of the ≈øame Church, lye as clearly upon us, from this duty of love to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed unto all, or any whom≈øoever, that we account a brother ≈øo farre forth as we have abillity, and opportunity, yea though in ≈øome re≈øpects becau≈øe of differences in judgements, and ways they be really our enemyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will yet be objected that we have nothing to do with the members of other Churches in re≈øpect of di≈øcipline and governement, but it belongeth wholly unto them to admoni≈øh, rebuke, ≈øu≈øpend, and excommunicate as need ≈øhall require, and if they doe it not, it is their ≈øinne.</p>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> To which I an≈øwer, It is their ≈øin if they doe it not, when they ≈øee cau≈øe for it. But if they doe it not, they ought to be admoni≈øhed of their duty, and neglect thereof, and if then they neglect any Church where he hath communicated, and ≈øo been owned as a brother may doe it, as to him and them, as after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition if he will not hear to ≈øu≈øpend him from any communion with them, as if be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will yet be objected that ≈øuppo≈øe they be not as yet of any Church, nor will not ingage to any party, how then can they be di≈øcipline if need ≈øhould require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> If it may be conceived in the judgement of charity that any ≈øuch is a brother he ought likewi≈øe to be owned as a brother, by any Church where he is knowne as ≈øuch, and be admitted to all the ordinances. And where he is admitted in any or many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es he is al≈øo ≈øubject to the di≈øcipline thereof, and cannot avoid it if he would, for he cannot avoid the Judgement of Chri≈øt, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he dwelleth, or removeth, and if he ≈øtay among≈øt them they may and ought to deale with him according as they do with bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and it will be as authoritative by the power of Chri≈øt as if he were a joynt member. For Chri≈øt will make good, and approve, and ble≈ø≈øe any ju≈øt mini≈øtration in his ≈øacred name (See Mat. 18.18, 19, 20.)</p>
            <p>And in my apprehen≈øion there it that are Godly, that are not yet joyned with any Church, ≈øave only in love, and private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and that cannot yet re≈øolve to be joyned to any but the body-mi≈øticall. And that becau≈øe their judgements are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ≈øome or other of each of their principles; and this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple la≈øt named is one of the greate≈øt ob≈øtructions to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of any that I know of, being not grounded on Scripture but on meer humane pollicy, and being the mo≈øt ob≈øtructive to love and communion: which God hath ≈øo ≈øtrictly commanded and charged on us above all other duties as hath been proved.

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> To this I an≈øwer, We mu≈øt and ought to do our duty to them whom we account brethren, what ever they thinke, or how ever they take it, if our con≈øciences be clear in the ≈øight of God, we ≈øhall have peace with him, though when we <hi>≈øpeake of peace</hi> to our brethren, <hi>they are bent for war.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if our brethren take it in the <hi>evill part,</hi> and de≈øpi≈øe our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and invitement, the fault is theirs in the ≈øight of God, and if they be ≈øtiffe ≈øpirited and malignant again≈øt us, let us take care that we give them no cau≈øe, but doe our be≈øt indeavour to remove all <hi>≈øtumbling blocks,</hi> and offences that are on our parts, and the Lord will ble≈ø≈øe us and hear our prayers, and reward our <hi>worke, and labour of love that we have ≈øhewed to his name,</hi> and for ought we know he may turne their hearts to be otherwi≈øe minded, then we expect, It may be our ≈øtiffene≈ø≈øe hath been a cau≈øe of theirs, and theirs of ours.

            <p>And give me leave a little, to inculcate and beat it home to our very con≈øciences.

Nay, Did he make it his bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, when he was ready to leave them, and to give it forth chiefely as his will and te≈øtament, and ≈øhall not we think it worthy to be made as our bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and that of greate≈øt concernement in this our age, and generation, becau≈øe <hi>the love of many waxeth cold</hi> already? However in this treati≈øe I ≈øtudy brevity, expecting that men better able, will make it their bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; And yet if I ≈øeem to repeat and fall on againe with the ≈øame Scriptures, it is to pre≈ø≈øe them further. Con≈øider therefore thus ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>A new commandement I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you, that ye al≈øo love one another,</hi> John 13.34.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider it I ≈øay, It is the commandement of Chri≈øt to all ≈øuch as are, and would be accounted, and knowne by all men to be his Di≈øciples, which is the promi≈øe annexed, ver≈ø. 35. <hi>By this ≈øhall all men know that ye are my Di≈øciples, if ye have love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the mea≈øure of this love is expre≈ø≈øed in the latter part of the 34. ver. <hi>to wit, As I have loved you, that ye al≈øo love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this mea≈øure of love is further explained, as to the latitude and extent thereof, in reference to the ≈øame command, <hi>to wit,</hi> John 15.12, 13. <hi>This is my commandement that ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as I have loved you,</hi> And how is that? See ver≈ø. 15. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay downe his life for his friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is the true and proper meaning of Chri≈øt without any mi≈øticall dark ≈øence.

And who≈øoever hateth his brother is a murtherer, and we know that no murtherer hath eternall life abiding in him</hi> See ver≈ø. 14.15 Read this Chapter throughout, and Ch. 4. wherein it is ≈øo evident that the Apo≈øtle pre≈ø≈øeth this duty of love as the great and chiefe≈øt, duty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chri≈øt, and that without which we cannot po≈ø≈øibly be a≈ø≈øured that we are yet <hi>pa≈ø≈øed from death unto life,</hi> nor that God loveth us, and we him, nor that we <hi>keep his commandements, and doe tho≈øe things that plea≈øe him,</hi> nor that we know God, or <hi>dwell in

And this commandement have we from him, that he who loveth God ≈øhould love his brother al≈øo,</hi> See Chap. 4. <hi>And this is the me≈ø≈øage that ye have heard from the beginning, that we ≈øhould love one another,</hi> Chap. 3.11.

            </p>
            <p>And againe, Becau≈øe if this love be in us in perfection as it ought, the naturall product of it will be ≈øuitable both in re≈øpect of our duties to God, and to our neighbours, for <hi>love worketh no evill again≈øt our neighbours,</hi> much le≈ø≈øe again≈øt God, See 1 Cor. 13.</p>

            <p>So words that come from the Spirit are Spirituall words, they are cordiall, fervent, earne≈øt, and powerfull words. They are words of life and power for edifying in the faith, <hi>and provoking unto love and good works.</hi> And therefore when men are acted and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43990:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> exerci≈øed from a root and principle of love, they are properly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exerci≈øed by the Spirit of God; And it is more proper to ≈øay ≈øo of them, then that they exerci≈øe their gifts, for it is their gifts, <hi>to wit,</hi> of the Spirit, and Faith, and Love, which exerci≈øe them. They are but the in≈øtruments, God is the Agent. It is God that granteth them <hi>according to the riches of his glory, to be ≈øtrengthned with might by his Spirit in the inner man, that Chri≈øt may dwell in their hearts by faith, that they being rooted and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chri≈øt which pa≈ø≈øeth knowledge, that they might be filled with all the fullne≈ø≈øe of God,</hi> See Ephe. 3.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now the ≈øpirit worketh faith, and worketh by faith, to make us capable of di≈øcerning all ≈øpirituall things, for they being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, as God him≈øelfe cannot be ≈øeene with bodily eyes, but only through an eye of faith, And <hi>faith worketh by love,</hi> and al≈øo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43990:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> love, See 1 The≈ø≈ø. 1.3. &amp; Gal. 5.6. For what we cannot ≈øee through faith and apprehend to be lovely, we cannot po≈ø≈øibly love it (I meane it) of ≈øpiritualls, and invi≈øibles. And therefore it followeth, that if we have but a little faith, a dim-eyed faith, we have al≈øo but a little love, and a little de≈øire after ≈øpirituall things, but are poor, and content al≈øo to remain poor in all ≈øuch re≈øpects, (See Rev. 3.7, 8.) But God hath <hi>cho≈øen the poore of this world, rich in faith, to be heirs of his Kingdome.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> al≈øo, his eyes were <hi>upon the faithfull in the Land; and upon the excellent that they might dwell with him.</hi> P≈øal. 101.6. But he was a man <hi>after Gods own heart,</hi> where ≈øhall a man be found now in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that maketh his choice after the ≈øame rule, to make them his a≈ø≈øociates, and <hi>companions, and delight, and his coun≈øellers,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, See P≈øal. 16.3. &amp; James 2. &amp; 2, 3, 4 5. And why is it? but for want of faith, which worketh by love, and worketh love to the choice≈øt objects that are the mo≈øt lovely, and al≈øo the mo≈øt loving, for there is a reciprocacy in this re≈øpect, in the ≈øight of God, as hath been ≈øhewed.</p>
            <p>But if it be conceived that many doe in a great mea≈øure as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, I ≈øay let us take the Apo≈øtles coun≈øell who be≈øeecheth in ≈øuch a ca≈øe, to <hi>increa≈øe more and more,</hi> (See 1 The≈ø≈ø. 4, 10.) which ≈øheweth that he would not have us re≈øt content with any poore or ≈øcant mea≈øures, but to be pre≈ø≈øing forwards, towards perfection in ≈øuch re≈øpects wherein we can never goe beyond the mark that is ≈øet us, and therefore it is that the Apo≈øtle biddeth, <hi>≈øeeing we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire and are zealous of ≈øpirituall gifts, ≈øeeke that we may excell to the edifying of the Church,</hi> See 1 Cor. 14, 12. From which it is evident that we may and ought to ≈øeek, that we might excell, provided it be not to make our ≈øelves famous in the eyes of men, but <hi>that our con≈øciences may bear us witne≈ø≈øe in the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> that our end is mainly <hi>for the edifying of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this end can never ≈øway us to any great zeal, unle≈ø≈øe our love to the Church ingage us to it, and the love of Chri≈øt mu≈øt as it were con≈øtraine us, as it did the Apo≈øtles, yea and even Chri≈øt him≈øelfe, now where love engageth us it will not pervert the end of ≈øuch ordinances which Chri≈øt hath left us for our edification, to make them as ≈øtumbling blocks, and as rocks of offence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct our communion, whereby we have occa≈øion for edifying one another in faith and love.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:43990:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But it will rather <hi>ca≈øt up and prepare the way, and remove the ≈øtumbling blocks out of the way of his people,</hi> See I≈øa. 57.14. That ≈øo all the elect and beloved of God may accord with us, and come in and con≈øecrate with us in all Chri≈øtian communion and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly fellow≈øhip, for it is the nature of love to unite cordially, for love is in the heart, and therefore it was that in the primative times, they that beleeved were of one heart, and of one mind, and the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe was, they had all things common.</p>
            <p>Now it is well known that cordiall love cannot be enforced, but mu≈øt be induced, we cannot cudgell it into the hearts of any; God is the Author and Fountaine thereof, nor can our ≈øeperation and keeping a part ever induce it, but it mu≈øt be induced through loving and kind fellow≈øhip, and communion together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that God hath commanded fellow≈øhip.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider ≈øeriou≈øly this Text of Scripture, what it clearely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, I ≈øpeak it as to wi≈øe men (as the Apo≈øtle did) to judge what I ≈øay of it, <hi>to wit,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Wherefore my dearly beloved, fly from idolatrie.

            <p>And let us con≈øider al≈øo another Scripture or two, <hi>to wit,</hi> Eph. 5.29, 30. <hi>No man</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>ever yet hated his own fle≈øh, but nouri≈øheth and cheri≈øheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church, for we are members of his body, of his fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And he gave him≈øelfe for it, that he might ≈øanctifie and clean≈øe it with the wa≈øhing of water by the word, that he might pre≈øent it to him≈øelfe a glorious Church, not having ≈øpot or wrinckle, or any ≈øuch thing, but that it ≈øhould be holy and without blemi≈øh,</hi> See ver. 25, 26, 27. Now if Chri≈øt ≈øo loved and hath owned his Church as members of his own body, and fle≈øh, and bones, and hath given him≈øelfe for it, and made it his bu≈øine≈ø≈øe to ≈øanctifie and clean≈øe it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if we ought to <hi>be followers of God as deare children, and to walke in love as Chri≈øt al≈øo hath loved us,</hi> As ver≈ø. 1, 2. Then doubtle≈ø≈øe we ought al≈øo to make it our bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and our maine bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of all other, to pre≈øent all the members of his body, the Church per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, we being al≈øo members one of another, (See Chap. 4.25.) as a perfect and glorious Church, without ≈øpot or wrinckle, or any ≈øuch thing. And to that end we mu≈øt <hi>let all bitterne≈ø≈øe, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evill-≈øpeaking, be put away from us, with all mallice. And be kinde one to another, tender-hearted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, even as God for Chri≈øts ≈øake, hath forgiven us,</hi> See Chap. 4.31, 32.</p>
            <p>The Lord open our under≈øtandings to con≈øider, and di≈øcerne how much the≈øe ≈øacred words of truth and faithfullne≈ø≈øe, concern us all in the≈øe dayes of ours, for his great names ≈øake, <hi>Amen.</hi>
